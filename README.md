# Who-s-Talking
A meeting tracker app for keeping track of how much each person talks in a meeting
This app was built using a flask back-end with most of the actual logic for the app taking place in JS on the front end. I am starting on a newer version of this app that will be a plotly dash app with the same basic functions
